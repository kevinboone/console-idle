  Definition of the KList class

  This class holds a linked list of references. Once added, the references
  "belong" to the list, and should not be called or modified except 
  by removing them from the list, or destroying the list.

// The comparison function should return -1, 0, +1, like strcmp. In practice
//   however, the functions that use this only care whether two things 
//   are equal -- ordering is not important. The i1,i2 arguments are 
//   pointers to the actual objects in the list. user_data is not used
//   at present

// A comparison function for list_sort. Rather confusingly, it looks exactly
//   like ListCompareFn, but the argument type is different. Here the i1,i2
//   are the addresses of pointers to objects in the list, not pointers.
//   So they are pointers to pointers. Sorry, but this is the way the
//   underlying qsort implementation works. For an example of coding a
//   sort function, see kstring_alpha_sort_fn. The user_data argument is
//   the value passed to the list_sort function itself, and is relevant
//   only to the caller

It is necessary to provide a comparison function, and items will be
removed (and freed) that satisfy the comparison function. 

IMPORTANT -- The "item" argument cannot be a direct reference to an
item already in the list. If that item is removed from the list its
memory will be freed. The "item" argument will thus be an invalid
memory reference, and the program will crash when it is next used. 

To remove one specific, known, item from the list, use klist_remove_ref()
