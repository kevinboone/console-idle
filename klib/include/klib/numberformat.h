/**  Format a 64-bit (or smaller) integer by separating the digits into
     groups of three. The separator can be any sequence of unicode or
     ASCII bytes, It's safe to supply a NULL for the separator, which 
     is useful in cases where this function is called by other 
     number-formatting routines that may, or may not, require separators. */

/** Format a 64-bit unsigned number, assumed to be the size of something
     (file, disk), so that if possible it is expressed using only three digits 
     (e.g., 1.23KB) and a suffix. 
   If 'binary' is TRUE, the units are KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB, which are all 
     integer powers of two. Otherwise, the units are KB, MB, GB, and TB, 
     all integer powers of 10. Note that in decimal mode, 1KB=1000B, not 1024, 
     as is the modern practice. Nearly all software that displays sizes now 
     uses the IEC standard binary units -- GiB, TiB, etc -- with the 
     exception of Microsoft.
   If sep is non-null, then numbers over 1000 are separated into groups of 
     three digits using the supplied separator. This will only happen in 
     binary mode.  */

      +  or -. If FALSE, there may be any amount of whitespace at the start 
      of the number, and any amount of anything at the end.

     This function understands scientific notation ("1.2E3"). The decimal
       separator is locale-specific.

    exponent is not in this range, write "E23" or "E-50" or whatever. Note 
    that this function is defined to return UTF8*, not char*, as a reminder 
    that the result may contain multi-byte characters.  As is common practice,
